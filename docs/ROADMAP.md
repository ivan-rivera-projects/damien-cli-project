# Damien-CLI Roadmap

This document outlines the current development status and future plans for Damien-CLI.

## Current Status (2025-05-20)

The project has successfully completed the initial development phases, establishing a core set of functionalities for Gmail management and AI integration.

* **Phase 0: Foundation & Setup - COMPLETE**
* **Phase 1: Core Email Read Operations - COMPLETE**
* **Phase 2: Core Email Write Operations & Basic Rules - COMPLETE**
* **Phase 3: LLM Integration & Advanced Features - IN PROGRESS**
  * **A3.1: Refine JSON output for CLI commands - COMPLETE**
  * **A3.2: Implement Rule Application Logic - COMPLETE**
  * **A3.3: MCP Server Development - COMPLETE**
  * **A3.4: Claude Integration - IN PROGRESS**

Key features implemented:
* Secure OAuth 2.0 authentication with Gmail.
* Email management: listing, view details, trash, permanently delete, label, mark read/unread.
* Rule management: add, list, delete, and apply rules via JSON definitions.
* MCP-compliant server for AI assistant integration:
  * FastAPI server with proper authentication
  * DynamoDB integration for session context management
  * Robust adapter layer connecting MCP to Damien core_api
  * Environment-based settings with proper nested model support
  * Comprehensive test suite for all components
* `--dry-run` mode for all write operations.
* User confirmation for destructive actions.
* Comprehensive unit test suite for CLI and server.

## Next Steps: Phase 3 Continued - AI Assistant Integration

The immediate focus is on completing the Claude integration for AI-powered email management.

* **A3.4: Complete Claude Integration**
  * **Goal:** Integrate Damien MCP Server with Claude to enable natural language email management.
  * **Key Tasks:**
    * Generate formal JSON schemas for all ten Damien tools
    * Configure Claude to access the MCP Server using these schemas
    * Test progressive interactions from simple to complex
    * Refine schemas and server behavior based on testing results
    * Document the integration process and user experience

* **A3.5: Performance Optimization & Security Hardening**
  * **Goal:** Ensure the MCP Server and Claude integration can handle production workloads securely.
  * **Key Tasks:**
    * Implement proper caching strategies for frequent requests
    * Add rate limiting to prevent API exhaustion
    * Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
    * Conduct security audit of the entire system
    * Implement monitoring and alerting

* **A3.6: MCP Server Deployment Options**
  * **Goal:** Create multiple deployment options for the MCP Server.
  * **Key Tasks:**
    * Local development setup (already implemented)
    * Docker containerization
    * Cloud deployment guides (AWS, GCP, Azure)
    * Simplified installation process for non-technical users

## Future Phases & Ideas (Beyond Phase 3)

* **Phase 4: Enhanced AI Capabilities**
  * Implement advanced LLM-based email analysis features:
    * Automatic categorization and labeling
    * Sentiment analysis and priority detection
    * Summary generation for long email threads
    * Intelligent rule suggestions based on user behavior
  * Explore fine-tuning LLMs specifically for email management tasks
  * Add support for multi-modal capabilities (handling images, attachments)

* **Phase 5: Expansion & Integration**
  * Support for other email providers beyond Gmail
  * Calendar integration for scheduling-related emails
  * Task management integration (convert emails to tasks)
  * Integration with other productivity tools

* **Phase 6: Commercial & Enterprise Features**
  * Multi-user support with permission management
  * Team-based rules and workflows
  * Advanced analytics dashboard
  * Enterprise deployment options
  * Compliance and security features (e.g., DLP, audit logs)

* **UI Development (Parallel Track)**
  * Terminal User Interface (TUI) using libraries like `Textual`
  * Web interface for non-technical users
  * Mobile app for on-the-go email management

This roadmap will be updated as the project progresses.
