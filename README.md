1. **Prerequisites:**
   * Python 3.13+
   * Poetry (Python dependency manager)
2. **Google Cloud Project & Gmail API:**
   * Follow the detailed instructions in `docs/GMAIL_API_SETUP.md` to enable the Gmail API and download your `credentials.json` file.
   * Place the `credentials.json` file in the root of this project directory.
3. **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/damien-cli.git # Update this URL
   cd damien-cli
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
5. **Initial Authentication with Damien:**
   Run any command that requires Gmail access, or `login` explicitly. This will open a browser window for you to authorize Damien with your Gmail account.
   ```bash
   poetry run damien login
   ```
   A `data/token.json` file will be created to store your authentication token.
